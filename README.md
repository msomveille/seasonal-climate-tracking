This repository contains the code for the analyses in the following manuscript:

Somveille M, Bossu CM, DeSaix MG, Alvarado AH, Gómez S, Rodríguez Otero G, Hernández-Baños BE, Smith TB & Ruegg KC. Broad-scale seasonal climate tracking is a consequence, not a driver, of avian migratory connectivity.

This repository contains three folders: scripts (which contains the code to run the analysis), resources (which contains the data), and results (where the analysis output is saved).

In the scripts folder, the file seasonal_climate_tracking_analysis.R contains the R code used for the analysis, and the file orsim.py contains the Python code used to run the ORSIM model.

The resources folder contains the file data_for_analysis_final.csv, which has the metadata (i.e. species, season, population and geographical coordinates for each sample) obtained from previously conducted genoscape analyses (see Data Accessibility Statement). The ecoregion polygons, climate rasters and species seasonal relative abundance surfaces, which are used in the analysis, are all downloaded from freely available sources (see manuscript).
